GWFv5 - Gizmore Website Framework Version 5.0


## gdo5


Gizmore Database Objects 5 consists of three core components.

- GDOQL is a small subset of an ORM.
- GDOType is a type system used in GDO, GWF_Forms, GWF_Modules, GWF_Methods and GWF_Tables.
- GDOCache features a hyperglobal single entity cache on the cost of overhead.
  Items are retrieved from the cache, even when new data has been queried.
  There is a second level cache via memcached.



### What is GWFv5?

Gizmore Website Framework 5 is built on top of gdo5.
It is meant to easily create dynamic websites or websocket servers.


### Why v5 now?

v4 was an attempt to make v3 mobile ready and add guest users on top of it. It failed.

The old version also had a lot of drawbacks compared to the current approach in v5.
As it's a recode from scratch, all modules that have been rewritten are quite nice and solid working with the new guest behaviour.


### What is is missing?

There is no unit testing.
