GWFv5 - Gizmore Website Framework Version 5.0


## gdo5


Gizmore Database Objects 5 consists of three core components.

- GDOQL is a small subset of an ORM.
- GDOType is a type system used in GDO, GWF_Forms, GWF_Modules, GWF_Methods and GWF_Tables.
- GDOCache features a hyperglobal single entity cache on the cost of overhead.
  Items are retrieved from the cache, even when new data has been queried.
  There is a second level cache via memcached.



### What is GWFv5?

Gizmore Website Framework 5 is built on top of gdo5.
It is meant to easily create dynamic websites or websocket servers.
